## Project Background and Overview

OnyX Coffee, established in 2018, is a South Africa-based company that sells coffee in three countries: South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. 
The company has a significant amount of data on its sales, product offerings, and loyalty program, which has been previously underutilized. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this data to uncover insights that will enhance OnyX’s profitability and commercial success. 

<b>Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key business areas:</b>

<b> 1. Sales Trends and Growth Analysis:</b> This involves evaluating OnyX’s historical sales patterns from 2019 to 2022 across its three operations, focusing on revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).<br>
<b> 2. Product Performance:</b> This section includes an analysis of OnyX’s product lines to understand their impact on overall sales.<br>
<b> 3. Loyalty Program Success:</b> This involves assessing the effectiveness of the loyalty program in driving customer sales.

This analysis will assist the OnyX’s product team to identify the most profitable coffee products and optimize pricing, the inventory Management team to ensure that the right quantities of each coffee product are stocked, and the marketing team to tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.

## Data Structure Overview

OnyX’s database structure as seen below consists of three tables: orders, customers , and products, with a total row of 1000 records. 

The Dataset was sourced on [Kaggle Website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/coffee-bean-sales-raw-dataset)

## Executive Summary

OnyX's sales analysis of 1000 orders from 2019 to 2022 shows annual revenue averaging $ 11,000, with South African operations contributing 77% (774) of orders received and 79% ($35,639) of total revenue from 2019 to 2022. OnyX has generated $45,134 of revenue from 1000 orders received in its three operations (South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana) from 2019 to 2022. 

The non-loyalty program customers account for 54% ($24,216) of revenue. OnyX can benefit from enhancing loyalty programs by introducing offers such as rewarding customers who spend more than the current average order value of $45 to increase customer lifetime value. A targeted marketing campaign in Namibia and Botswana, along with improvements to digital channels like the mobile app, will strengthen OnyX's market position and drive sustainable growth.
