## Project Background and Overview

OnyX Coffee, established in 2018, is a South Africa-based company that sells coffee in three countries: South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. 
The company has a significant amount of data on its sales, product offerings, and loyalty program, which has been previously underutilized. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to thoroughly analyze this data to uncover insights that will enhance OnyX’s profitability and commercial success. 

<b>Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key business areas:</b>

<b> 1. Sales Trends and Growth Analysis:</b> This involves evaluating OnyX’s historical sales patterns from 2019 to 2022 across its three operations, focusing on revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).<br>
<b> 2. Product Performance:</b> This section includes an analysis of OnyX’s product lines to understand their impact on overall sales.<br>
<b> 3. Loyalty Program Success:</b> This involves assessing the effectiveness of the loyalty program in driving customer sales.

This analysis will assist the OnyX’s product team to identify the most profitable coffee products and optimize pricing, the inventory Management team to ensure that the right quantities of each coffee product are stocked, and the marketing team to tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.
